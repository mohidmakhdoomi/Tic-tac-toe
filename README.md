# Tic-tac-toe
Application designed and developed using 2 different machine learning algorithms and provides different modes (human vs. human, human vs. AI, AI vs. AI). minimaxttt.py and abttt.py are the actual applications, the other two programs were made to test the algorithms.

This application was designed and developed as an assignment for the course CS 1XA3. The application testminimax.py and minimaxttt.py implement the Minimax algorithm while testab.py and abttt.py implement the Alpha-beta pruning algorithm. 

Both testminimax.py and testab.py take an input state of a tic-tac-toe game and output all resulting game states using their corresponding algorithm. 

Both minimaxttt.py and abttt.py have three modes, 0 player (game between AI), 1 player (human vs. AI) and 2 players (human vs. human). The user is also given a choice of whether X goes first or O as well as the option to enter an initial state for the game. In both 0 and 1 player modes the AI's decisions are made using the corresponding machine learning algorithm for that file.
